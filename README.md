Convolutional Neural Network Applied to the Classification of Bird Species

Abstract—The objective of this work is to design a classification
system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) apllied to
the classification of bird species.The classes of species used in
this classifier are: Ardea alba, Butorides striata and Dendrocygna
viduata. The dataset used is composed of 6,000 samples of
color images, being divided into two sets, one for training
and the other for testing. CNN’s architecture consists of 5
layers of Convolutional and 5 layers of MaxPooling interspersed
respectively, in addition to a Flatten layer and a Fully Connected
layer. The results obtained with the cross-validation performance
measure for the classifier system correspond to an average hit
value of approximately 94% of the test images.
